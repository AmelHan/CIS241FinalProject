    <p> My name is Amel Hanifi and I would love to welcome you to my home page. I am passionate about front-end web development and designs. It is one of the reasons I am perusing the Application Development degree at Edmonds Community College and expect to graduate June 2020. I love spending my days crafting websites and strive to deliver perfection. I enjoy learning new things about the world of web design and try to improve my skills every day.</p>
<p>We moved to the emerald city in 2015 and fell in love with it. Seattle was just made for us. Beautiful weather, amazing people and so many job opportunities. I am also a mother of a beautiful 2 years old "Adam" who just happens to be my raison of life. My determination to provide the best life possible for him drives me to be the best professionally.</p>
<p>You will find further information about me including my interests, reflections & my resum√©. I invite you to explore my site and encourage you to share any comments and questions with me through my email link.</p>
