	<h1> Fun Things I learned this quarter !</h1>

	<p>  Learning HTML and CSS was probably one of my biggest challenge this quarter. I had so much fun creating web pages that looked very professional by following specific guides.
	I also lerned how to style those pages with embedded CSS or stylesheets. Creating forms was also very fun. You really need be details oriented to be succesful as a web developper.
	 I am planning to take the CIS 242 next quarter, which is the Javascript class. I am really excited about it, because my pages will get even better and more attractive. You can do so much more with Javascript.</p>

	<h2> Database</h2>

	<p> As you probably know, almost all businesses from small online stores to Fortune 500 corporations use data to run their operations.Because of this, the demand for database administration experts has exploded.
	Because of this demand, I have decided to take these amazing classes where Database notions have no secrets at all. I am currently working on 2 different Projects. The first one is a databse using Microsoft Access.
	My second project is a database that will manage my recipes, under MySQL data server. The project will bundle all the queries we learned in this class.</p>
